    <h1>Performance Overview</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>A compelling reason to use React Native instead of Web View-based tools is to achieve 60 frames per second and provide a native look and feel to your apps. Whenever feasible, we aim for React Native to handle optimizations automatically, allowing you to focus on your app without worrying about performance. However, there are certain areas where we haven't quite reached that level yet, and others where React Native(similar to writing native code directly) cannot determine the best optimaization approach for you. In such cases, manual intervention becomes necessary. We strive to deliver buttery-smooth UI performance by default, but there may be instances where that isn't possible.</p>
        <p>This guide is intended to teach you some basics to help you to <span style="background-color: rgb(165, 226, 249);">troubleshoot performance issues, as well as discusss common sources of problems and their suggested solutions</span>.</p>
